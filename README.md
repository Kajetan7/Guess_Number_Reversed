# Guess Number Reversed Game

This is a command-line game where the computer tries to guess a number that the player has chosen between 0 and 1000. The game ends when the computer correctly guesses the number or the player switches the number during the game.

## Usage

To use this game, simply download the `guess_number_reversed.py` file and run it with Python 3.

The program will prompt you to think about a number between 0 and 1000. After you have chosen your number, the program will guess the number up to 10 times. You need to give feedback to the computer after each guess whether the guess is "too big", "too small", or "you are correct". The game will end when the computer guesses your number or when 10 guesses have been made.
